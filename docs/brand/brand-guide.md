# Brand Guide — Sirius Systems

The full brand reference. The root `brand.md` is a one-pager; this is the working document for design, copy, and engineering.

> Items marked **TBD** are waiting on the client (tracked in `docs/site-os/inputs/content-needed-from-client.md`). Do not fill them in with invented values. Use the documented placeholder until the real value lands.

---

## 1. Brand identity

### Name
**Sirius Systems**

- Always spelled `Sirius Systems` — capital S, capital S, single space.
- Never `SiriusSystems`, `Sirius System`, `siriussys`, or all-caps.
- The handle / short form `SiriusSys.io` (as used on Facebook) is acceptable in URL contexts only.

### Tagline
**TBD** — pending client decision. Until then, no tagline is shipped anywhere a tagline would appear (header lockup, OG cards, footer).

### Positioning (working — confirm with client)
> Sirius Systems builds AI-powered automation, smart websites, and reputation systems that help local service businesses capture more leads, book more jobs, and grow without adding headcount.

Once confirmed, this line becomes the source-of-truth one-liner used in:
- Home hero
- Meta description fallback
- About page intro

## 2. Voice & tone

### Voice (consistent across the brand)

- **Confident** — assert what works without hedging. "This is how X works" rather than "We think X might help."
- **Plainspoken** — short sentences, plain words. We sell technical capability to non-technical buyers; never make them feel dumb.
- **Outcome-first** — lead with what it does for the business, not what it is internally. "Books appointments while you're on the roof" > "Multi-agent LLM with calendar integration."
- **Honest about limits** — when something is hard, say so. We sell trust services; oversell undoes us.

### Tone (varies by surface)

| Surface | Tone notes |
|---------|------------|
| Home / capstone | Confident, ambitious, but grounded |
| Service pages | Practical, technical-but-clear, outcome-focused |
| Industry pages | Empathic — show we get the daily reality |
| Blog (how-to) | Instructive, no fluff, examples > theory |
| Blog (opinion / founder's note) | First person, opinionated, signed |
| Legal pages | Neutral, clear, no marketing language |
| Errors (404, form errors) | Helpful, friendly, brief, no jokes that age poorly |

### Words and phrases to avoid

- "Best", "#1", "leading", "premier", "trusted by thousands" — unless documented
- "Unlock", "supercharge", "next-level", "10x", "game-changer" — clichés
- "AI-powered" stuck on every noun — pick what's actually AI-powered
- "Solutions" used as a vague filler ("our solutions help your business...")
- "Cutting-edge", "state-of-the-art", "revolutionary"

### Words and phrases we prefer

- "Built for" rather than "designed for" (more concrete)
- "System" rather than "platform" (matches the brand)
- "Capture", "book", "follow up", "earn" — verbs the buyer already uses
- "Local service business" — our actual ICP, named explicitly

### Capitalization

- Sentence case for headlines, not title case ("Smart websites for local service businesses").
- Exceptions: brand name, product names, proper nouns (Google Business Profile, etc.).

## 3. Color (TBD — placeholders)

> The actual brand colors are blocked on the client (items 1.6 + 1.7 in `content-needed-from-client.md`). Until they arrive, the Tailwind theme uses the placeholders below. Components built before colors are confirmed include a `// TODO color` comment referencing this section.

### Placeholder palette (replace on confirmation)

| Token | Hex (placeholder) | Use |
|-------|-------------------|-----|
| `primary` | `#0EA5E9` | CTAs, links, key accents |
| `primary-foreground` | `#FFFFFF` | Text on primary |
| `secondary` | `#1E293B` | Section backgrounds (dark) |
| `secondary-foreground` | `#F8FAFC` | Text on secondary |
| `background` | `#0B0F19` | Page background (dark-leaning theme) |
| `foreground` | `#F8FAFC` | Body text |
| `muted` | `#94A3B8` | De-emphasized text, meta |
| `accent` | `#22D3EE` | Hover, focus rings |
| `destructive` | `#EF4444` | Errors, destructive actions |
| `border` | `#1F2937` | Hairlines |

When real colors arrive, update this table, the Tailwind config, and search the codebase for the placeholder hex values.

### Color use rules

- **Primary** is reserved for CTAs and the brand mark. Don't paint sections in primary.
- **One primary CTA per viewport** — secondary actions are ghost buttons.
- **Body text never on a non-tested background** — verify contrast ≥ 4.5:1.

## 4. Type (TBD — placeholders)

> Type pairing is blocked on the client (item 1.8). Placeholders below until confirmed.

### Placeholder pair

- **Display:** Inter (variable) — fallbacks: `system-ui, -apple-system, "Segoe UI", Roboto, sans-serif`
- **Body:** Inter (variable) — same fallbacks
- **Mono:** `ui-monospace, "SF Mono", Menlo, Consolas, monospace`

When real pair arrives, update Tailwind theme + font loading + this file.

### Scale

| Token | Size | Line height | Use |
|-------|------|-------------|-----|
| `display` | 60px / 72px | 1.05 | Hero headlines |
| `h1` | 48px / 56px | 1.1 | Page headlines |
| `h2` | 36px / 44px | 1.15 | Section headlines |
| `h3` | 24px / 32px | 1.25 | Subsection |
| `h4` | 20px / 28px | 1.3 | Card titles |
| `body` | 18px | 1.6 | Body text |
| `small` | 14px | 1.5 | Meta, captions |

Adjust scale for mobile (-10–20% on display/h1).

### Type rules

- **Max 70 characters per body line** (use `max-w-prose` or equivalent).
- **One display headline per page** (the hero).
- **No more than two type weights in active use** beyond regular (typically: regular + semibold/bold).

## 5. Logo (TBD)

> Logo files are blocked (item 1.5). Until they arrive, the header uses a wordmark in the display typeface at the placeholder primary color.

When real logo arrives:

- SVG light, SVG dark, favicon source (SVG/PNG at 512×512)
- Define clear-space (≥ logo height on all sides)
- Define minimum size (≥ 24px tall for header, ≥ 16px for favicon-derived contexts)
- Define monochrome variants for inverse / single-color use

## 6. Iconography

- Use a single icon library across the site (recommended: Lucide). Do not mix libraries.
- Stroke icons preferred over filled.
- 1.5px or 2px stroke weight, consistent across sizes.
- No emoji as icons in UI chrome.

## 7. Imagery direction

- **No stock photo clichés** — handshake, laptop on coffee table, "diverse team smiling at whiteboard."
- **Lean into abstract / geometric / "stellar" motifs** — Sirius is a star; the brand can use that visual cue without going corny.
- **Prefer AI-generated heroes** where licensing of stock isn't worth it; image prompts live in `docs/brand/image-prompt-bank.md`.
- **People photos** require permission. No invented faces.

## 8. UI / UX direction

- **Dark-leaning theme** as default (matches the futuristic / systems positioning). Light mode optional, post-launch.
- **Generous whitespace** — Sirius Systems is not a low-rent service. Spacing communicates value.
- **Sectioned, opinionated layouts** — each page section makes one point.
- **Sticky header**, simple nav (Services / Industries / Blog / Contact).
- **One primary CTA color**, used sparingly.
- **Form fields** are large, obvious, and forgiving (clear error states, no surprise validations).

## 9. Component primitives (Phase 1)

When the codebase scaffolds, these are the primitives we expect:

- `Button` (variants: primary, secondary, ghost, link)
- `Input`, `Textarea`, `Select`
- `Card`
- `Section` (page section wrapper)
- `Container` (max-width wrapper)
- `Heading` (semantic + scale)
- `Prose` (long-form content style)
- `Badge`, `Tag`
- `Callout` (info / warning / success)
- `BlogCard`
- `ServiceCard`
- `IndustryCard`

Built with Tailwind utility classes + headless primitives (Radix or shadcn-style) — no opinionated CSS-in-JS.

## 10. Accessibility

- All interactive elements keyboard-reachable.
- Focus styles visible (don't override the browser ring without a replacement).
- Color contrast ≥ 4.5:1 for body, ≥ 3:1 for large text and graphics.
- All form fields have programmatic labels.
- No information conveyed by color alone.
- `aria-` attributes where needed; no `aria-` theater where not.

## 11. Motion

See `docs/brand/motion-guidelines.md` — subtle, purposeful, no auto-playing video on first paint.

## 12. Open questions for client (mirror of `content-needed-from-client.md`)

- Tagline?
- Primary + secondary brand color?
- Display + body type pair?
- Logo (light + dark + favicon source)?
- Founder bio + headshot?
- Final positioning line?
